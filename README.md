## The Android Undertaker lives here.

Experiments with android-y things I needed to make just because. Because I saw them and thought I might be able to make them.

### Dotty Circles Animation

Inspired by [this](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cw0ddsVLQlS/) React, Tailwind, and Framer motion animation.

Implemented in Jetpack Compose [here](app/src/main/java/com/kinnerapriyap/undertaker/ui/composables/DottyCirclesAnimationScreen.kt).

### Slot Machine Animation

Inspired by the [Genius square](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/273065/genius-square) game.

Implemented in Jetpack Compose [here](app/src/main/java/com/kinnerapriyap/undertaker/ui/composables/SlotMachineAnimationScreen.kt). There might be some lag because of ~I don't know yet~.

You can find the 3d models to print for the game [here](https://github.com/kinnerapriyap/the-android-undertaker/tree/main/3dModels/slotAnimation). 
Print a set for each player - blocker x 7, board x 1, puzzle pieces x 1. The storage model can hold 2 sets, the top is a bit too tight so cut off a side (or print at 105%?) and it should work fine, but I will rework it at some point. Heehee also why you don't see the top in the picture below.
